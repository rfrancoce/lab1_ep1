I don't recommend a IDE for complete beginner because it automatically complete your half written word thus not
letting you learn them well. Of course you can disable autocomplete feature. But, I think beginner should work 
close to the metal. And as they developed into intermediate they can use IDE's because usually at that stage simple
text editors won't suffice. Long story short, a beginner should use IDLE because it is builtin and it has basic features.
But, if you insist for more complete IDE PyCharm is the best.
